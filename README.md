GP2Y1010 Sensor Library
=========================
Follows the tutorial on https://github.com/sharpsensoruser/sharp-sensor-demos/wiki/Application-Guide-for-Sharp-GP2Y1014AU0F-Dust-Sensor


This library automatically calibrates the sensors offset. However, to determine the slope of the linear function mapping from voltage to dust density one needs to calibrate the sensor in two points using a highly accurate particle sensor.
